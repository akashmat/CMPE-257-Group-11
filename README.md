### 1. Project: Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction

### 2. Dataset
Dataset taken from the [Kaggle Competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/data)

### 3. Problem Description
The competetion involves the prediction of thermostability of enzyme variants (regression). The experimentally measured thermostability (melting temperature) data includes natural sequences, as well as engineered sequences with single or multiple mutations upon the natural sequences.

Biotechnology has a basic challenge in trying to understand and reliably predict protein stability. Enzyme engineering can be used to address issues like sustainability, carbon neutrality, and other global challenges. Enzyme stability improvements may save expenses and speed up concept iteration for scientists.
